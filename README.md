Html, css 

Creating page based on figma:

- Use of semantic tags (header, nav, ul, footer, etc.) wherever is necessary
- All fonts, colour palette, elements sizes must strictly match the design.
- Pixel perfect is also not required, BUT your website should visually match the design template (i.e. If the element is horizontally centred on the design, it should look centred on the website)
- Basic cross-browser support (website should look correctly on last versions of modern browsers(Chrome, Safari, Edge)
